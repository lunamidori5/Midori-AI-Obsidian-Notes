## Concept Exploration

### Carly

### Initiative System

- Per user cooldown preference?
	- Ability for a use to expand or narrow their cooldown 

- How does she determine what she wants to do?
	- Goal oriented? 
	- Does she have personal/systems goals
	- Does she have global objectives

### Internal Context extrapolation
- Where does the model/models house its internal context awareness
	- Currently Supposed to be Working Awareness Model #2 [[WA-Inst-9-23]]
- How is this established?
	- What grants permission for a contextuality to be committed
	-

## Feature Exploration / Wish List

### Carly

- Needs a dynamic goal system
	- Dynamic Personal/System Goals
	- Dynamic Goal extrapolation based on user/OP requests

- Needs a formalized emotional simulation system
	- Dynamically adjusted perspectives of individual users
	- heat map
	- radar graph

- Context resolution / combination
	- rendering down repeated and heavily referenced / high priority information to a "priority context"
	- 

- Scheduling system
	- Ability to set deadlines / meetings / future events
	- Hold to her schedule

- Dedicated User Preferences for responses
	- Cadence
	- Tone

- Context Expansion
	- Greater context window
	- Perpetual context window?
	- 

- Pre-Awareness intervention/Audit criteria and flagged thought/action detection
	- specify and elaborate upon the system responsible for detecting and flagging questionable thoughts / actions the Agent has before they reach Working Awareness
	- currently a [[sub-model moderation tool request]] (OpenAI Moderation Tool/ Google Gemini Moderation Tool)

- Formalized Knowledge Graph
	- Represents total knowledge of the system
	- Represents knowledge interconnectivity and relevance 
	- Represents the relational quality of a knowledge point to all other points 

- **How does the Carly training system create relational and relevancy connections between any two desperate points of "concept" within the training data**
	- Relational inferences and interconnectivity / relevance weighting should be 
		- A Known Process 
		- The results should be ultimately Human Interpretable

### Midori-AI

- New Website platform and design
	- Current Hugo *Theme* is bad and ugly
	- Get off Hugo or find an elegant way to change the *theme*
